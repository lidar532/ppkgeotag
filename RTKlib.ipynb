No need to install RTKlib, Python, or anything else on your computer.  Simply upload your raw receiver data to Colabs, Open and run each cell, and your data will be processed and a precision trajectory will be generated.  Sample data are also provided.  Use the upload button on the left panel (select the file folder icon to show the file area) to upload your GNSS data for processing.  Once your data are processed, download the results from the File pane area.\n","\n","* **RTKlib Install:** Installs the Linux version of RTKlib on your Google Colabs virtual machine. To install, simply click the: `[ ] rtklib_install(): Install RTKlib`.  To install sample datasets, click the: `[ ] !git clone. Install Sample Datasets`\n","* **RTKlib Convert raw to RINEX:** Use this cell to convert raw GNSS data to RINEX for use with RTKlib.  First, click:\n","\n"," `[ ] def rtkconvert(). Convert RAW to RINEX` to load suporting functions, and then click:\n","\n"," `[ ] GUI: Convert a CWW-PPK raw GPS data file to RINEX for processing.`  Copy and paste a raw file name into the `Raw_File_Name` text input box.  The `Data_source` is preloaded with various UAS; however, you can simply enter another name in the associated text box.  `Marker_Name` and `User_Comment` can be anything you like.  These data will be used to populate the resulting RINEX header section.  After filling your data, simply click the`[ ]` to run the conversion.  The command will rename your input file and all output files based to reflect the date and time the data were collected.\n","\n","* **Teqc RINEX Quality Check:** Use UNAVCO's Teqc to examine the quality of any RINEX file.\n","  * `[ ] Teqc +qc. A RINEX Observation (*.Obs or *.19o) file.`  Paste a RINEX file name in the input field, and then press the `[ ]` to examine and generate a Teqc report.  This is an optional step and is not required to process data.\n","\n","\n"," * **RTKlib. Prep RINEX for upload to OPUS. (Resample to lower rate):** This cell will prepare your base station data to be sent to OPUS.  You can skip this step if you are either using an existing CORS stations, or you know the precise position of your base station.  To use this feature, execute the `[ ] def prep_for_opus()` to load necessary functions, and then populate the fields in the `[ ] GUI: Prep RTKlib Local Base RINEX to send to OPUS or to use with RTKlib (static).` cell.  Once the fields are populated, press the `[ ] Gui:` button.  Download the results, and send to OPUS.\n","\n"," * **RTKlib functions:** Execure the following cells to load required functions:\n","    * `[ ] dms2dd( dms )` \n","    * `[ ] rtklib_print_settings( settings ); Display the Kinematic Processing Settings.` Only execute this function if you want to examine all of the RTKlib settings that will be used to process your data.\n","\n"," * **RTKlib. Configure Base and General**\n","    * `[ ] rtklib_general_config(Base_RINEX).` Run this cell to load required functions.\n","    * `[ ] (Required data) Load Base Station RINEX Files and settings to use.` Populate the fields with your data.  The `Base_RINEX` field can be populated with one or more comma (\",\") separated base station observation files.  The system will sequentially process each rover against each base station.  \n","    There is no need to enter additional nav, gnav, or sp3 files as those contain the same data. The `Base_Longitude_X`, `Base_Latitude_Y`, and `Base_Elevation_Z` values must be in the same format as used within an OPUS Report and they are not required at all if you select `RINEX Header` or `OPUS Report` for `Base_Coordinates_Source`.  \n","    If you upload an OPUS Report, populate `OPUS_Report_File` with the name, the program can automatically extract the base station coordinates from the file and populate the base position as required by RTKlib.\n","\n","* **RTKlib. Process.** Generates PPK trajectories.  Populate and execute the following cells to generate trajectories:\n","  * `[ ] rtklib_process()` Execute to load required functions.\n","  * `[ ] Generate an RTKlib GNSS Trajectory.` Populate the fields, and select the RTKlib options, and then press the `[ ]` to generate trajectories.  You can put more than one rover/UAS observation file in the `Aircraft_RINEX` field.  The program will process each rover/UAS file against each base station observation file loaded into the `Aircraft_RINEX` field in the `[ ] RTKlib. Configure Base and General` section.\n","\n","* **Generated output files:**\n","  * **\\*-pos.txt**:  RTKlib position output file. \n","  * **\\*-elev.kmz**: Kmz version of the **\\*-pos.txt** with elevation displayed.\n","  * **\\*-flat.kmz**: Kmz version of the **\\*-pos.txt** with flattened elevation displayed.\n","  * **\\*-conf.txt**:  Configuration settings used to generate the **\\*-pos.txt** file.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"keWPaRaEa3Da"},"source":[],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3pAnjIRZghBo"},"source":["# A.
