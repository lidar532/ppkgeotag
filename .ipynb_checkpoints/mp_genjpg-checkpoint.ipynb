    "# mp_genjpg: Multi-processor ARW to JPG converter\n",
    "C. W. Wright [Github.com/lidar532](https://github.com/lidar532)\n",
    "\n",
    "mp_genjpg walks a directory containing \n",
    "[raw Sony ARW photo files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format#ARW), and generates a\n",
    "Linux bash script which will use all CPU cores to generate jpg or other\n",
    "photo files.  After gathering the list of raw photos, it divides them by the number\n",
    "of CPU cores on your computer, and then generates a list for each core of input and output\n",
    "file names.  A Bash script is generated that will run several copies (one per core) of GraphicsMagick \n",
    "configured to convert the raw file to jpg (or other) output format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program runs on a windows-10 based jupyter Python Notebook and generates\n",
    "a bash script suitable for execution on a [Windows-10 WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage:\n",
    "1. Configure the `User Inputs` variables to set the jpg quality, directory for mission, images, output, script\n",
    "1. Run the code cell.\n",
    "1. Start a WSL Linux terminal in your selected script directory\n",
    "1. Execute the generated bash script.  Example `bash generate-jpgs.bash`.( _It will generally run for hours._)\n",
    "1. Once script completes, check to make sure the output directory has the correct file count\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Inputs:\n",
    "The user changes the following variables in the program as required.  ***Important note: This program is \n",
    "somewhat unique because it runs on Windoze but generates a script that must run on Linux. It is important\n",
    "that the script_dir and idir variables are set using windows drive:filepath convention, and the mission_dir and odir\n",
    "variables use the Linux filepath convention.***\n",
    "```css\n",

    "* ***odir***:         The directory to store the resulting converted photo files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output:\n",
    "1. Linux bash script file to generate Jpegs and a file of EXIF data extracted frmo the raw photo files\n",
    "1. A 1-deep directory populated with Jpeg photos derived from the input raw photo files\n",
    "1. A set of files containing the input file names of the raw and resulting Jpeg file names.\n",
    "1. An single EXIF file containing the necessary EXIF info to sync each photo with PPK GPS.\n",

    "### Result EXIF File\n",
    "* The EXIF file contains the following columns and column headers:\n",
    "    - ***filename*** _(example: 2020-0209-182755-DSC00793-17103-N7251F.ARW)_\n",
    "    - ***date_time*** _(Example: 2020:02:09 18:27:46)_  Note: The columns are ',' delimited and the date_time is delimited with a space character\n",

    "[raw camera photo files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format#ARW).\n",
    "* [xargs](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/xargs.1.html).  Builtin to WSL Linux. Feeds command-line parameters from a file to the GraphicsMagick program.\n",
    "* [Sed.  (stream editor) is a Unix utility that parses and transforms text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed)\n",
    "* [Tr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr_(Unix)) Takes two sets of characters (generally of the same length), and replaces occurrences of the characters in the first set with the corresponding elements from the second set.\n",
    "* [Exiftool for Linux.](https://exiftool.org/)  Used to extract EXIF data from the raw photos.  Exiftool options and examples [can be found here](https://exiftool.org/exiftool_pod.html#RENAMING-EXAMPLES)\n",
    "* [Adobe Digital Negative Converter](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/adobe-dng-converter.html) *recommended* Can be used to convert ARW files to DNG.  It is multithreaded and will do the conversion significantly faster than oter methods.\n",
